This webpage is designed to help Astrophotographers, Avid Skywatchers, and even Space Agencies look to the skies on specific days for both Astroids and even the ISS! The webpage uses the zipcode entered finds the latitude and longitude and displays information on when the next closest astroids will be passing. The info displayed for these astroids are their name, size in meters, its distance from Earth at its closest point in kilometers, and if it has the potential to hit Earth.  

Below this chart is another chart indicating when the next visible pass of the International Space Station will occure. It uses the latitude and longitude to give an accurate visible times, Cardinal Coordinate, and the angle off the horizon at its culmination point. It will gather information on the next three visible passes.
